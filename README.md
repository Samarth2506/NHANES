> Some typical ML and DL method to predict conditional survival analysis: **Maxima of Pr(years left to live|assuming die in 10 years)** . For next, add a new category representing patients not dying in 10 years in neural network: **Maxima of Pr(years left to live)**

> manipulate between mortstat and permth_exm to get target category

> Fourier transform time-series signal and feed into neural network
